    <h2>A Message From My Heart 💌</h2>
    <p>
        Dear Gurleen 🤍,<br><br>
        I met you on the first day of college without knowing that this one
        meeting would turn into the most beautiful friendship of my life.
        From Semester 1 till now, we have shared gossips, lunch breaks,
        endless laughs, and memories that I will cherish forever.<br><br>

        You are not just my best friend, you are my comfort, my happiness,
        and my safe place. With you, even ordinary days feel special.
        Thank you for always standing by me and making my college life
        so meaningful.<br><br>

        On your birthday, I just want you to know how grateful I am to have
        you in my life. No matter where life takes us, I want you by my side
        for a lifetime. Always choosing you. Always choosing us 🫶
    </p>
